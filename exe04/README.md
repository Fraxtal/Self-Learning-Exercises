Python Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous Programming with asyncio: Exercises that introduce asynchronous programming using the asyncio library can be valuable, especially in modern Python development.

1. Write a Python program that creates an asynchronous function to print "Python Exercises!" with a two second delay.

2. Write a Python program that creates three asynchronous functions and displays their respective names with different delays (1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds).

3. Write a Python program that creates an asyncio event loop and runs a coroutine that prints numbers from 1 to 7 with a delay of 1 second each.

4. Write a Python program that implements a coroutine to fetch data from two different URLs simultaneously using the "aiohttp" library.

5. Write a Python program that runs multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently using asyncio.gather() and measures the time taken.

6. Write a Python program to create a coroutine that simulates a time-consuming task and use asyncio.CancelledError to handle task cancellation.

7. Write a Python program that implements a timeout for an asynchronous operation using asyncio.wait_for().

8. Write a Python program that uses asyncio queues to simulate a producer-consumer scenario with multiple producers and a single consumer.
