Exercise 1: Email Validator with Decorator and Regex
    Write a Python class called EmailValidator that can validate email addresses using regular expressions. Implement the following:
    
    Use a class decorator to add a regular expression pattern as a class attribute.
    Implement a property decorator to get and set the regular expression pattern.
    Write a method called validate(email) that returns True if the email matches the pattern and False otherwise.
    
    Exercise 2: Get Next Line
    Write a Python generator function called file_reader that reads a text file line by line. Implement the following:
    
    Accept a file path as a parameter when calling the generator function.
    Open the file in read mode and iterate over its lines.
    Yield each line as a string.
    
    Exercise 3: Counter Closure
    Write a closure function called counter that counts the number of times it has been called. Implement the following:
    
    The closure function should return a nested function.
    The nested function should increment a counter variable each time it is called.
    The closure function should return the nested function.
    
    Exercise 4: Person Class with Property
    Create a Python class called Person with the following properties:
    
    name: a private instance variable for the person's name.
    Implement a getter method using the @property decorator to retrieve the person's name.
    Implement a setter method using the @name.setter decorator to set the person's name.
    
    Exercise 5: Password Validator with Decorator
    Write a Python function called password_validator that validates a password string using regular expressions. Implement the following:
    
    Use a function decorator to check if the password meets certain criteria.
    The criteria should include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
    Return True if the password meets the criteria, and False otherwise.
